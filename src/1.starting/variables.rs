fn main() {
  let a_number = 10;
  println!("The value of a_number is: {}", a_number);
  // We can't change the value of a_number because it's immutable
  // Lets try to declare b_number and make it mutable
  let mut b_number = 20;

  // Now we can change the value of b_number
  b_number = 30;

  // Lets try to see what is variable shadowing
  
  // Declare first variable binding with name "shadow_num"
  let shadow_num = 5;
  // Declare second variable binding, shadows existing variable "shadow_num" 
  let shadow_num = shadow_num + 5;
  // Declare third variable binding, shadows second binding of variable "shadow_num"
  let shadow_num = shadow_num * 2; 

  println!("The number is {}.", shadow_num);


  // Lets type some code to see how does it works
  
  // ======================== INTERGER TYPES ========================
  // Variable as a 32-bit integer
  // The u in u32 stands for unsigned and if we use i32 it will be signed integer
  // We need to keep in mind that rust allow types of intergers of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 bits
  // Then isize and usize depend on the architecture of the computer
  // For example, if we are using 64-bit architecture, isize and usize will be 64 bits
  // If we are using 32-bit architecture, isize and usize will be 32 bits
  let x : u32 = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

  // ======================== FLOATING POINT TYPES ========================
  // Rust has two types of floating point numbers: f32 and f64
  // f32 is a single-precision float and f64 is a double-precision float
  let y : f32 = 3.0;
  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
  
  // ======================== BOOLEAN TYPES ========================
  // Rust has a boolean type, bool, which can have two values: true and false
  let is_true : bool = true;
  println!("The value of is_true is: {}", is_true);

  // ======================== CHARACTER TYPES ========================
  // Rust has a char type to represent a single Unicode character
  let character : char = 'ðŸ˜‚';
  println!("The value of character is: {}", character);
 
  // ======================== STRING TYPE ========================
  // Rust has a string type, str, which is a sequence of Unicode scalar values encoded as a UTF-8 byte sequence
  // Rust also has a string slice type, &str, which is a reference to a string

  // This is a pointer to a string in memory that we can access
  let string : &str = "Hello, world!";
  println!("The value of string is: {}", string);
  // With the type String, we can create a mutable, growable piece of text
  let string : String = String::from("This string is mutable and growable");
  println!("The value of string is: {}", string);



  // ======================== COMPOUND TYPES ========================
  // Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays
  // Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size
  // Tuples are useful when you want to combine a number of values into one compound value
  // Arrays are useful when you want to store a collection of values of the same type
  // Tuples can have elements of different types
  // Arrays must have elements of the same type
  // Tuples can be destructured to create bindings for each element
  // Arrays can be indexed to access individual elements
  let tuple : (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
  let (a, b, c) = tuple;
  println!("The value of a is: {}", a);
  println!("The value of b is: {}", b);
  println!("The value of c is: {}", c);

  // We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access
  let five_hundred = tuple.0;
  let six_point_four = tuple.1;
  let one = tuple.2;
  println!("The value of five_hundred is: {}", five_hundred);
  println!("The value of six_point_four is: {}", six_point_four);
  println!("The value of one is: {}", one);

  // Arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples
  // Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
  // Arrays are useful when you want to have a collection of elements of the same type
  // Arrays are useful when you want to iterate over the elements of the array
  // Arrays are useful when you want to access elements by index

  let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  println!("The value of array is: {:?}", array);

  // We can access an element of an array by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access
  let first = array[0];
  let second = array[1];
  println!("The value of first is: {}", first);
  println!("The value of second is: {}", second);

  let defined_array : [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  println!("The value of defined_array is: {:?}", defined_array);
  let _array_of_zeros : [i32; 5] = [0; 5];

  
  // ======================== VECTOR TYPE ========================

  // Declare vector, initialize with three values
  let three_nums = vec![15, 3, 46];
  println!("Initial vector: {:?}", three_nums);  
    
  // Declare vector, value = "0", length = 5
  let zeroes = vec![0; 5];
  println!("Zeroes: {:?}", zeroes); 

  // Create empty vector, declare vector mutable so it can grow and shrink
  let mut fruit = Vec::new();
  // Push values onto end of vector, type changes from generic `T` to String
  fruit.push("Apple");
  fruit.push("Banana");
  fruit.push("Cherry");
  println!("Fruits: {:?}", fruit);
  // Remove last element from vector
  fruit.pop();
  println!("Fruits: {:?}", fruit);

  // ======================== STRUCT TYPE ========================
  // Rust has a struct type to define custom data types
  // Structs are useful when you want to group related data together
  // Structs are useful when you want to create a new type that has its own fields
  // Structs are useful when you want to implement methods on a type
  // Structs are useful when you want to implement traits on a type
  // Rust supports three struct types: classic structs, tuple structs, and unit structs. These struct types support different ways to group and work with the data.
  // Classic structs are useful when you want to name each field in the struct
  // Tuple structs are useful when you want to name the struct itself, but not the fields
  // Unit structs are useful when you want to create a type that has no fields

  // Define a struct named "Person" with two fields: name and age
  struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
  }

  // Define a struct named "Unit" with no fields
  struct Unit;

  // Define a struct named "Tuple" with one field
  struct Tuple(i32);

  // Define a struct named "Classic" with three fields
  struct Classic {
    field1: i32,
    field2: f64,
    field3: u8,
  }


  // Create an instance of the "Person" struct
  let person : Person = Person {
    name: String::from("Alice"),
    age: 30,
  };

  // Create an instance of the "Unit" struct
  let _unit : Unit = Unit;

  // Create an instance of the "Tuple" struct
  let tuple : Tuple = Tuple(5);

  // Create an instance of the "Classic" struct
  let classic : Classic = Classic {
    field1: 500,
    field2: 6.4,
    field3: 1,
  };

  // Access the fields of the "Person" struct
  println!("The name of the person is: {}", person.name);
  println!("The age of the person is: {}", person.age);

  // Access the fields of the "Tuple" struct
  println!("The value of the tuple is: {}", tuple.0);

  // Access the fields of the "Classic" struct
  println!("The value of field1 is: {}", classic.field1);
  println!("The value of field2 is: {}", classic.field2);
  println!("The value of field3 is: {}", classic.field3);

  // ======================== ENUM TYPE ========================
  // Enums are types that can be any one of several variants. What Rust calls enums are more commonly known as algebraic data types. 
  // The important detail is that each enum variant can have data to go along with it.
 
  // enum WebEvent {
  //   // An enum variant can be like a unit struct without fields or data types
  //   WELoad,
  //   // An enum variant can be like a tuple struct with data types but no named fields
  //   WEKeys(String, char),
  //   // An enum variant can be like a classic struct with named fields and their data types
  //   WEClick { x: i64, y: i64 }
  // }

  //   The enum in our example has three variants of different types:
  //   > WELoad has no associated data type or data.
  //   > WEKeys has two fields with data types String and char.
  //   > WEMClick contains an anonymous struct with named fields x and y, and their data types (i64).


  // We define an enum with variants similar to how we define different kinds of struct types. 
  // All the variants are grouped together in the same WebEvent enum type. Each variant in the enum isn't its own type.
  // Any function that uses a variant of the WebEvent enum must accept all the variants in the enum. We can't have a function that accepts only the WEClick variant, 
  // but not the other variants.

  // Define a tuple struct
  struct KeyPress(String, char);

  // Define a classic struct
  struct MouseClick { _x: i64, _y: i64 }

  // Redefine the enum variants to use the data from the new structs
  // Update the page Load variant to have the boolean type
  enum WebEvent { 
    WELoad(bool), 
    WEClick(MouseClick),
    WEKeys(KeyPress) }

  let _we_load = WebEvent::WELoad(true);
  // Instantiate a KeyPress tuple and bind the key values
  let _keys = KeyPress(String::from("Ctrl+"), 'N');
  // Set the WEKeys variant to use the data in the keys tuple
  let _we_key = WebEvent::WEKeys(_keys);
  let _click = WebEvent::WEClick(MouseClick{ _x: 100, _y: 250 });


  // ======================== HASHMAP TYPE ========================
  // Rust has a standard library type, HashMap, that is a key-value store
  // HashMaps are useful when you want to store data that can be looked up by a key

  // Import the HashMap type from the standard library
  use std::collections::HashMap;
  let mut reviews: HashMap<String, String> = HashMap::new();
  
  reviews.insert(String::from("Ancient Roman History"), String::from("Very accurate."));
  reviews.insert(String::from("Cooking with Rhubarb"), String::from("Sweet recipes."));
  reviews.insert(String::from("Programming in Rust"), String::from("Great examples."));

  println!("Reviews: {:?}", reviews);
  println!("Review for Ancient Roman History: {:?}", reviews.get("Ancient Roman History"));

  reviews.remove("Cooking with Rhubarb");
  println!("Reviews: {:?}", reviews);
